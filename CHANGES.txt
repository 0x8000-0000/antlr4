ANTLR v4 Honey Badger

November 18, 2012

* fixed: undefined rule refs caused exception
* cleanup, rm dead etypes, add check for ids that cause code gen issues
* added notion of one-off error

November 17, 2012

* .tokens files goes in output dir like parser file.
* added check: action in lexer rules must be last element of outermost alt
* properly check for grammar/filename difference
* if labels, don't allow set collapse for
  a : A # X | B ;
* wasn't checking soon enough for rule redef; now it sets a dead flag in
  AST so no more walking dup.
  error(51): T.g:7:0: rule s redefinition (ignoring); previous at line 3

* Change version to 4.0b4 (btw, forgot to push 4.0b3 in build.properties when
