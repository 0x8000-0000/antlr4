/** Test parser execution.
 *
 *  For the non-greedy stuff, the rule is that .* or any other non-greedy loop
 *  (any + or * loop that has an alternative with '.' in it is automatically
 *  non-greedy) never sees past the end of the rule containing that loop.
 *  There is no automatic way to detect when the exit branch of a non-greedy
 *  loop has seen enough input to determine how much the loop should consume
 *  yet still allow matching the entire input. Of course, this is extremely
 *  inefficient, particularly for things like
 *
 *     block : '{' (block|.)* '}' ;
 *
 *  that need only see one symbol to know when it hits a '}'. So, I
 *  came up with a practical solution.  During prediction, the ATN
 *  simulator never fall off the end of a rule to compute the global
 *  FOLLOW. Instead, we terminate the loop, choosing the exit branch.
 *  Otherwise, we predict to reenter the loop.  For example, input
 *  "{ foo }" will allow the loop to match foo, but that's it. During
 *  prediction, the ATN simulator will see that '}' reaches the end of a
 *  rule that contains a non-greedy loop and stop prediction. It will choose
 *  the exit branch of the inner loop. So, the way in which you construct
 *  the rule containing a non-greedy loop dictates how far it will scan ahead.
 *  Include everything after the non-greedy loop that you know it must scan
 *  in order to properly make a prediction decision. these beasts are tricky,
 *  so be careful. don't liberally sprinkle them around your code.
 *
 *  To simulate filter mode, use ( .* (pattern1|pattern2|...) )*
 *
 *  Nongreedy loops match as much input as possible while still allowing
 *  the remaining input to match.
