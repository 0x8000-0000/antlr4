/** A DFA state represents a set of possible NFA configurations.
 *  As Aho, Sethi, Ullman p. 117 says "The DFA uses its state
 *  to keep track of all possible states the NFA can be in after
 *  reading each input symbol.  That is to say, after reading
 *  input a1a2..an, the DFA is in a state that represents the
 *  subset T of the states of the NFA that are reachable from the
 *  NFA's start state along some path labeled a1a2..an."
 *  In conventional NFA->DFA conversion, therefore, the subset T
 *  would be a bitset representing the set of states the
 *  NFA could be in.  We need to track the alt predicted by each
 *  state as well, however.  More importantly, we need to maintain
 *  a stack of states, tracking the closure operations as they
 *  jump from rule to rule, emulating rule invocations (method calls).
 *  Recall that NFAs do not normally have a stack like a pushdown-machine
 *  so I have to add one to simulate the proper lookahead sequences for
 *  the underlying LL grammar from which the NFA was derived.
 *
 *  I use a list of NFAConfiguration objects.  An NFAConfiguration
 *  is both a state (ala normal conversion) and an NFAContext describing
 *  the chain of rules (if any) followed to arrive at that state.  There
 *  is also the semantic context, which is the "set" of predicates found
 *  on the path to this configuration.
 *
 *  A DFA state may have multiple references to a particular state,
 *  but with different NFAContexts (with same or different alts)
 *  meaning that state was reached via a different set of rule invocations.
